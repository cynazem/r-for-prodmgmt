# R for Product Management

## Background
### Aims
Produce a repository of useful scripts in R for Product Managers

### Audience
As the name suggests, Product Managers dealing with data that want to use R as a tool to analysis that data and produce reports/visualisations. If you don't have any R experience then you will need to install R

* Local install on Windows
  * Install R from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
  * Install RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
* Install in Cloud9
  * [StackOverflow answer on how to use R and Cloud9](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36897276/how-to-install-r-on-the-cloud-9-ide)
  
 The scripts should work pretty much unaltered from source, but if you want to edit then you'll need some background. Bit thof these intor courses are free:
 * [Try R at Codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r) is a good intro that covers wide range of topics, but without much depth
 * [Introduction to R at Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) gives a much deeper understanding of data types and R structure.

I already used Sublime as my text editor and can recommend [R-Box](https://github.com/randy3k/R-Box) to improve the R support - e.g. it adds R Markdown syntax highlighting.

## Reports
## Google Analytics
This first section has some reports to get usage stats from Google Analytics, an example Shiny app for some data exploration using data controls, and a template R Markdown report to show how this can be manipulate and presentedd.

## Elasticsearch
Example analysis of components and logging output, including relative error rates - Coming soon

## InfluxDB
Working with time series data generated by the product, the two examples here are API response times and feature usage. This includes an example of manipulating time series data to set missing values to 0. 

## UptimeRobot
Simple example of taking error data and using a pivot table to explore the data, after some cleaning and filtering. This kind of workflow can be useful with large data sets.
